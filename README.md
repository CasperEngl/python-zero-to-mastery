# Python Zero To Mastery

Repository for the course Python Zero To Mastery. This repository contains all the code examples and exercises I needed to complete in order to finish the course.

[Python Zero To Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/) is a course by Andrei Neagoie on Udemy. It is a course that teaches you Python from the ground up. It starts with the basics and ends with advanced topics like decorators, generators, and more.

## Playground

The playground contains experiments with Python along with other languages such as Bash, TypeScript, and Rust. The code there is based on the Python source code and the help of GPT 4 to generate the code in other languages.

## Playground Project "New Lesson"

This playground project helps me create new lesson directories for the course. It is a simple script that creates a new directory with the lesson number and the lesson name. It also creates a main.py file with the lesson name in a title comment.

It currently has the following options:

- Python (My version)
- Bash (Courtesy of GPT 4)
- TypeScript (Courtesy of GPT 4)
- Rust (Courtesy of GPT 4)
